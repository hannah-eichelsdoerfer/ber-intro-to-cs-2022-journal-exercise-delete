To trace your progress you can mark completed tasks by inserting an X within the square brackets [ ] in the `README.md` file in VSCode.

## Prepare

Unsure about gitHub?
â†’ Review [Version Control with Git and GitHub](https://redi-school.github.io/ber-dcp-intro-to-computer-science/docs/git/git_and_github_desktop/) lesson.

In `GitHub Desktop` clone this repository: https://github.com/ReDI-School/ber-intro-to-cs-2021-html-journal

Create a new branch, which will contain your new version of the project with the new feature. In GitHub Desktop, do this by clicking on Current Branch > New Branch or Branch > New Branch. Give your branch (version) a useful and descriptive name, ideally about the changes/feature you want to make in this version.

    â†’ for most of our class activities we will select "For my own purposes" - for contributing to open source projects or projects owned by others, select "To contribute to the parent project"

#### See your changes

- you can open the folder in your finder/explorer and double click on index.html (disadvantage: every time you make changes you have to reload the page)
- `Live Server` is a great tool to see your changes in real time (you should have installed it at the beginning)
- Every time you save your website will automatically get the newest changes
- To start the Live Server either right click in the root index.html file and select **Start Live Server** (Option 1) or click on **Go Live** (Option 2) in the bar at the bottom - when it is running it will say `Port: 5500` there - always leave it running to see the changes.

### Push (upload) your work to github

- In GitHub Desktop create a new branch

- Run the following command to create a new branch
  - `git checkout -b my-html-work`
- Run the following command to prepare all the files to be uploaded to github
  - `git add .` (don't forget the "dot")
- Run the following commit the changes to the local git branch on your laptop
  - `git commit -m "my html file changes"`
- Run the following command to upload your local git branch to your github fork which is on the internet
  - `git push -u origin my-html-work`
- Open a Github pull request from your `my-html-work` branch to the main branch of your fork `main` or `master`
- Merge the pull request
- Victory!

## Extra:

### Publish to github pages

- so far our website is only a local file
- to share a link that others can visit we need to host our pages somewhere, luckily gitHub has a option called `GitHub Pages` to host our repository files on the internet
