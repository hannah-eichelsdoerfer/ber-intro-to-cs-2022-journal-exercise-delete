#### See your changes

- you can open the folder in your finder/explorer and double click on index.html (disadvantage: every time you make changes you have to reload the page)
- `Live Server` is a great tool to see your changes in real time (you should have installed it at the beginning)
- Every time you save your website will automatically get the newest changes
- To start the Live Server either right click in the root index.html file and select **Start Live Server** or click on **Go Live** in the bar at the bottom - when it is running it will say `Port: 5500` there - always leave it running to see the changes.

### Publish to github pages

- so far our website is only a local file
- to share a link that others can visit we need to host our pages somewhere, luckily gitHub has a option called `GitHub Pages` to host our repository files on the internet
- now every time you push to your main branch, your files will be deployed to github pages
